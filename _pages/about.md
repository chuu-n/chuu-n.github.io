**About Me**  
I moved to the United States from [Myanmar](https://chuu-n.github.io/blog/) at 17 without a clear idea of what I wanted to do or where life would take me. Now, at 25, I’ve earned an Associate of Science in Biology from Austin Community College and a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience from The University of Texas at Austin. Over the past eight years, one of the most meaningful outcomes of my journey has been discovering a strong interest in research and a commitment to serving my community.

I created this website to share my academic work and career goals, while also providing a space that reflects my cultural background. My goals with this site are to:

- Share resources with the Myanmar community living in the United States
- Raise awareness of the challenges faced by people in Myanmar
- Encourage others in my community to support one another

**Who I Am**  
I grew up in Burma, where topics like education, mental health, and well-being are often overlooked. These early experiences have shaped my interest in understanding not just individual cognitive development, but also the broader social and environmental factors that influence it.

I currently work as a lab manager in the Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience Lab and a research associate at the Memory and Aging Lab at The University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on executive function in children, memory in older adults, and how factors like sleep, socioeconomic status, and summer learning opportunities affect cognitive outcomes. I’m trained in various research methods, including fMRI, EEG, behavioral assessments, and wearable technologies. I’ve presented my work at national conferences such as FLUX, SLEEP, and the Cognitive Neuroscience Society.

With a background in neuroscience and a growing interest in developmental science, I hope to contribute to research that helps reduce disparities in education and development—especially for children and families from underserved communities.
