I assisted in collecting EEG and fMRI data from participants aged 18 to 80 and administered behavioral assessments, including the Trail Making Test (TMT), Digit Span Memory Test, and California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT). I conducted principal component analysis in RStudio using sleep data gathered from wearable monitors and EEG data, which was preprocessed using EEGLAB in MATLAB. Through linear regression analyses, I explored how sleep variability relates to age and memory reconstruction. I presented this work at the SLEEP 2024 Conference in Houston and the Cognitive Neuroscience Society Conference in Boston, and I am currently preparing the manuscript for journal publication.",
